implementations that need google api:

1. map
    grab current location of the user and projects all the incidents as markers on the map
    -html/js uses Google Maps Javascript API
    an array of [date, latitude, longitude] is passed to front end from back end
    date will be the 'content' of the marker

2. emergency sos
    grab current location (grabiing geolocation same as map not using google api) of the user and then pass to backend
    the latitude and longitude coordinates (through a READ ONLY json form) 
    so a google map link can be formed and thus sent to emergency contacts
        - refer to send_emergency_sos.html !!!!!

3. make_report
    using Google Places API
    when typing in a location for the incident, the user can autocomplete their location
        - for example: University of California will bring suggestions like UCLA, UCSD, UCSB etc
    once a selection has been made, the latitude and longitude of that location will be
    shown as READ ONLY (so users can't edit) text that is sent back to the back end
    back end will then take the latitude and longitude and push it to the database to store
        this information of coordinates is then logged in the coordinates part of the database
        which will be projected on the map
